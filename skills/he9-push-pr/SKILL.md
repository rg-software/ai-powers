# Push and create a pull request

Goal: push the current feature branch and open a pull request.

**Invocation.** The invocation text is the words after the skill name. The single word `commit` means "commit first, without prompting, then continue" (see Step 1). Any other or empty text is the normal path.

**Project inputs (optional adapter).** Read `.opencode/powers.jsonc` if present; it overrides the defaults below. This skill uses: `baseBranch` (default `origin/HEAD`; if unset, ask and offer to record it), `tracker` (auto: the git remote host's forge, else ask; a forge name resolved to a CLI (gh/tea/glab) per this contract's "Resolving the tracker"). Probe for paths; if one is absent, skip that step rather than guessing. Use the resolved tracker's tooling.

## Step 1. Prepare and push

- Verify the working tree is clean (`git status`).
- If there are uncommitted changes and the invocation text is **not** `commit`: inform the user, suggest committing, and stop. Do not update or push the branch.
- If there are uncommitted changes and the invocation text **is** `commit`: run the `he9-commit` skill's workflow without prompting, then continue.
- Ensure the branch is up to date; fetch and merge/rebase against the resolved `baseBranch` if needed.
- Push the branch; set upstream on first push (`git push -u origin <branch>`).

## Step 2. Draft PR content

- Title from the branch's commits: `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline`, where `<base>` is the resolved `baseBranch`; prefer the primary Conventional Commit subject.
- Body from the commit history and the diff against the resolved `baseBranch`: what changed and why; include the verification performed (per `he9-commit`).
- Link the tracked issue from the branch name (`issue-{id}`): `Resolves #123` or `Fixes #123`. Skip if not issue-based.

## Step 3. Open the PR

- Check whether an open PR already exists for the branch (via the resolved tracker's tooling).
  - If one exists: show its link, reuse it, and do **not** create a second PR. Only update its title/body if the user explicitly asks.
  - If none exists: create the PR targeting the resolved `baseBranch`.

## Step 4. Respect existing PRs

- If the branch already has an open PR, the push is the final step.
- Do not ask for confirmation before pushing.
- Do not open a duplicate PR.
